# calendarParser
Parses text file from Brookline softball schedule email into a file that can be uploaded into google calendar.


## future plans
In the future it would be great to build this into a flask app that could be fronted by a simple web UI where the user could simply copy and paste in text from an email and then directly upload it to their connected Google Calendar.
